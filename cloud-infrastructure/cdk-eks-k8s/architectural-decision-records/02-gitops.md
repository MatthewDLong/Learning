## Status

accepted

## Context

GitOps is a software development methodology that involves using Git as the single source of truth for defining and managing infrastructure and application configuration. The three main elements to GitOps are:

- Infrastructure as code (IaC)
- Pull Requests (PRs)
- Continuous Deployment (CD)

Overall, GitOps provides a modern, efficient, and scalable approach to managing infrastructure and application configuration. By leveraging Git as the single source of truth, GitOps helps teams to improve collaboration, consistency, efficiency, and security.

## Options

A). Adopt GitOps

## Decision

Adopt GitOps

## Implications

There are many significant benefits to adopting GitOps, some are:

- Continuous Deployment: GitOps enables continuous delivery by providing a fully automated and auditable process for delivering infrastructure and application changes. This helps reduce time-to-market and improves overall agility.

- Efficiency: GitOps streamlines the infrastructure management process by allowing teams to define and manage infrastructure as code (IaC) in Git. This enables teams to automate the provisioning and management of infrastructure, which reduces manual work and errors.

- Scalability: GitOps allows teams to manage and scale infrastructure more easily by using Git to manage configuration and track changes. This helps teams to easily spin up new environments, replicate configurations, and scale resources.

- Consistency: GitOps ensures that all infrastructure and application configuration is stored in a single, version-controlled repository. This helps eliminate configuration drift and ensures that all environments are consistent.

- Auditing: GitOps provides an auditable record of all infrastructure and application changes, which makes it easier to track who made changes and when. This helps improve compliance and reduces the risk of errors or unauthorized changes.

- Collaboration: GitOps encourages collaboration across teams and departments by enabling developers, operations, and security teams to work together on infrastructure and application configuration. This improves communication and reduces silos.

- Security: GitOps improves security by using version-controlled repositories to manage and audit infrastructure and application changes. This provides a centralized source of truth for all configuration and reduces the risk of security vulnerabilities.
